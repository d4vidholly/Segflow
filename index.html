          <h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
For the past few seasons, I’ve taken part in a football predictor league run by a friend for fans of my team, Middlesbrough. While it’s all for fun, the process of submitting predictions via Excel spreadsheets had become frustrating for both participants and the organiser. I decided to explore a better way to run the game by designing and building a prototype web app that simplifies the experience—especially for less tech-savvy users.
</p>

<h3>Current Format – Key Issues</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Reliance on Desktop Excel</strong><br>
    Participants had to download a spreadsheet, input scores, save the file, and email it back—introducing friction from the start and no mobile-friendly alternative.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Tech Literacy Gaps</strong><br>
    Some users didn’t have Excel, while others accidentally formatted scores as dates or submitted blank files, resulting in confusion and back-and-forth.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Manual Submissions</strong><br>
    One family member (who will not be named!) wrote all their scores on paper, photographed it, and texted it to me—only to miss two fixtures. She still beat me in the final table.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Design Challenge</h3>

<p>I set out to build a tool that:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Simplifies the Experience</strong> – Make it easy for everyone to enter predictions—especially those with limited digital experience.</li>
  <li><strong>Adds Enjoyment</strong> – Move beyond spreadsheets to something more visually engaging and interactive.</li>
  <li><strong>Creates Value</strong> – With all predictions captured centrally, there's potential for data visualisation and storytelling.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Importantly, the prototype still exports an Excel file to maintain compatibility with the current system, but this can evolve with organiser input.
</p>





<h3>Design Approach</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Wireframes</strong><br>
    I began by sketching the user journey and basic screens, focusing on a smooth experience. This began as desktop-first but quickly developed into a mobile-friendly flow.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>User Flows</strong><br>
    Tested edge cases—scores are saved locally in case of a crash, and a “Clear All” button was added with a reset confirmation to avoid accidental loss.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Key Features</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Season Summary Tool</strong><br>
    After submitting predictions, users get a snapshot of how their season might play out. It highlights their overall tone—optimistic or pessimistic—compared to realistic outcomes, helping players imagine their season unfolding and adding narrative to what was once a static task.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Fixture Colour Coding</strong><br>
    Visual cues change fixture colours based on predicted results (win, draw, loss), making it easier to interpret at a glance.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Records Awareness (Planned Feature)</strong><br>
    The app could flag if a prediction breaks a historical record—e.g. “10–0 vs Sunderland would be our biggest ever league win.”
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>User Feedback</h3>

<blockquote>
  “I would definitely use this for next season’s challenge.”
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  “Love the visual colour change of the fixtures based on the result I predicted.”
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  “The season report is a great overview of my predictions—definitely too optimistic!”
</blockquote>

<h3>Next Steps</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Add admin tools for compiling results and managing leaderboards</li>
  <li>Explore real-time prediction comparisons and historical stats</li>
  <li>Integrate with external fixture APIs for live updates</li>
  <li>Review whether Excel remains the best database format going forward</li>
</ul>

          <section>

<p><strong>Tag Running</strong> is a web-based concept designed to reframe how recreational runners—particularly aging or returning athletes—track and interpret their progress. While running is an inherently personal pursuit, our understanding of achievement has become heavily stat-driven. Yet, as <a href="https://www.goodrunguide.co.uk/AgeGrading.asp" target="_blank">Good Run Guide</a> describes, many runners find that once their peak personal bests are behind them, it becomes difficult to benchmark progress or maintain motivation.</p>

<p>Tag Running reimagines this experience by focusing on <strong>True Age Grading</strong>—a system that adjusts run times based on age and gender but presents the data in a more accessible, visual, and emotionally resonant way.</p>

<h2>Key Issues with the Current Process</h2>

<p><strong>Limited Visibility and Usability</strong><br>
Age-graded times exist but are buried in single columns on sites like Parkrun or tucked away on outdated platforms with poor UX.</p>

<p><strong>Lack of Motivation for Most Runners</strong><br>
The current system focuses on elite comparisons (world record pace) and provides little encouragement for new or mid-tier runners—especially anyone below a 60% grading, who sees no actionable insight.</p>

<p><strong>Disconnect in Data Relevance</strong><br>
Parkrun’s grading model doesn’t reflect the unique difficulty of different courses. A flat 5K isn’t the same as a hilly trail run, so runners feel a disconnect between how they feel and how they score.</p>

<p><strong>Opaque Grading System</strong><br>
The difference between 61% and 68% is unclear, and there’s no narrative or feedback to help runners improve or set goals. The system lacks context, clarity, and continuity.</p>

<h2>Design Approach</h2>

<p><strong>User Discovery</strong><br>
Analysed how runners engage with Parkrun—searching by course, gender, age, and start time. This informed the filtering system. Acknowledged accessibility concerns around binary gender collection in the source data.</p>

<p><strong>Visual Storytelling</strong><br>
Replaced dry data tables with a dynamic chart that offers clarity at a glance. Inspired by sports performance apps, the visualisations and messaging are designed to feel empowering rather than judgmental.</p>

<p><strong>UI & UX Considerations</strong><br>
Incorporated Parkrun’s colour palette to maintain familiarity, with light-touch branding that feels like an extension of the existing ecosystem. Microcopy and alert messages help set user expectations, particularly where data is missing or skewed.</p>

<p><strong>Scoring Over Percentages</strong><br>
Introduced a new scoring system—a higher, more abstract number that tracks personal growth in a gamified way, providing motivation even below traditional performance thresholds.</p>

<h2>Key Features</h2>

<p><strong>Course-Specific Benchmarking</strong><br>
Users can search and compare performance by Parkrun course, with historical age-graded data visualised clearly.</p>

<p><strong>Personal Growth Insights</strong><br>
The system contextualises a user’s current level—local, regional, or national standard—with potential to track improvement over time.</p>

<p><strong>Visualised Goal-Setting</strong><br>
Instead of vague targets, runners receive tangible goals (“Drop 2 minutes to hit next tier”) linked to future runs or training blocks.</p>

<p><strong>UX Writing to Support All Levels</strong><br>
Carefully written microcopy encourages all users, particularly beginners or those returning after injury or time off.</p>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>

<p><strong>Data Expansion</strong><br>
Complete collection and cleaning of Parkrun course data across a wider sample to ensure national coverage.</p>

<p><strong>Training Integration</strong><br>
Link results to tailored training plans (e.g. “Drop 2 minutes in 6 weeks” prompts with a suggested program).</p>

<p><strong>Local Club Integration</strong><br>
Based on the user’s level and location, suggest relevant running clubs to support next steps in real life.</p>

<p><strong>Social Features</strong><br>
Explore ways for users to share results as graphic summaries—ideal for personal milestones or social accountability.</p>

<p><strong>Edge Case Testing</strong><br>
Resolve limitations in the current scoring system (e.g. handling 99:99 finish times or extreme outliers) to ensure robustness across all data inputs.</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
My old football club has run weekly social matches for over 20 years. After the long-time organiser retired, his manually maintained database of player ratings and positions was lost—along with the ability to create balanced teams. With talk of moving to a fully randomised system, I built a prototype web app to help the new organiser generate fairer teams based on historical data, using a more visual and user-friendly interface.
</p>

<h3>Key Issues with the Current Process</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Loss of Knowledge:</strong> The previous organiser’s knowledge of players, positions, and quality was crucial and not recorded systematically.</li>
  <li><strong>Team Imbalance:</strong> Ratings were helpful but lacked precision when dealing with unknown player positions or late dropouts.</li>
  <li><strong>Desktop-Only Workflow:</strong> The process wasn’t mobile-friendly, making last-minute changes difficult on the go.</li>
  <li><strong>Lack of Visualisation:</strong> There was no quick way to assess team balance visually or adjust teams intuitively.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Design Approach</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Conversation-Led Discovery:</strong> I spoke with the previous organiser to identify key pain points and the factors he considered when forming teams.</li>
  <li><strong>Simulator-Inspired UI:</strong> The goal was to emulate the look and feel of a football management simulator—something familiar and intuitive for the age group.</li>
  <li><strong>Simple Ratings System:</strong> Players are rated on a 1–3 star scale to keep team formation fast and accessible, with the option to evolve with more data over time.</li>
  <li><strong>Spreadsheet Import:</strong> Player pools can be imported from an existing spreadsheet, populating cards with position, quality, age, and optional friendships.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Key Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Player Cards:</strong><br>
    Each player is displayed with a compact card showing key attributes. The design makes it easy to scan and compare players at a glance.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Visual Team Generator:</strong><br>
    Teams are arranged into formations on a pitch layout, with draggable players and real-time team strength updates. Swaps on desktop or tap-based adjustments on mobile dynamically update the scoreline.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Match Preview + Stats:</strong><br>
    A dedicated pre-match screen shows positional strength comparison via bar charts and visualised metrics to aid deeper, data-driven balancing.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Minimum Player Alerts:</strong><br>
    A live counter and alarm system ensure the organiser is warned if the minimum 10-player threshold isn’t met before kick-off.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Next Steps</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Add option to save and reload past squads or team sheets</li>
  <li>Enable organiser notes for tracking late dropouts or player absences</li>
  <li>Refine matchmaking algorithm with machine learning or feedback loop over time</li>
  <li>Explore shareable match links or mobile-only simplified versions for wider access</li>
</ul>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    I researched, designed, and built a modern web app version of the <strong>Wembley 2016 board game</strong> using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal was to preserve the nostalgic value of the original while solving long-standing usability and relevance issues. The live site replaces outdated, often misplaced physical components with a dynamic, customisable digital experience.

  <h2>Original Game – Key Issues</h2>

<p><strong>Complexity:</strong> Cumbersome rules and fiddly mechanics (especially money distribution) slowed down gameplay and frustrated players.</p>

<p><strong>Dependence on Physical Components:</strong> The game relied on custom dice and hard-to-find rule books—making it unplayable if anything was missing.</p>

<p><strong>Unfair Mechanics:</strong> Dice outcomes felt unbalanced, and team strength lacked transparency, affecting fairness.</p>

<p><strong>Outdated Elements:</strong> Team lineups became obsolete quickly due to promotion and relegation in real-world football.</p>

</figure>

<h2>Design Approach</h2>

<p><strong>User Experience First:</strong> Created wireframes focused on how players choose teams—prioritising alphabetical ordering, visual clarity, and intuitive layout.</p>

<p><strong>Modern Interface:</strong> Drawing inspiration from football apps and live broadcasts, I introduced updated club badges, player ratings, and a clean, football-fan-friendly interface.</p>

<p><strong>Enhanced Gameplay Context:</strong> Key gameplay variables—like international stars, game rules, and available funds—are clearly presented before kickoff to reduce confusion mid-game.</p>

<p><strong>Customisable Mechanics:</strong> Dice rolls, team selection, and gameplay elements are now fully customisable, allowing for up-to-date seasonal versions and flexible rule sets.</p>
