    <p>Segflow is a collection of web tools designed to solve real-world problems in grassroots sports and leisure, helping players and organisers streamline their processes.</p>
    <p>Each tool is based on research into specific user flows—identifying friction points and designing accessible, focused alternatives. The process behind these solutions moves from sketch to wireframe to live, functional app, combining service design thinking with front-end development. Together, they reflect a hands-on approach to building digital tools that make everyday systems faster and easier to use.</p>

          <h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
For the past few seasons, I’ve taken part in a football predictor league run by a friend for fans of my team, Middlesbrough. While it’s all for fun, the process of submitting predictions via Excel spreadsheets had become frustrating for both participants and the organiser. I decided to explore a better way to run the game by designing and building a prototype web app that simplifies the experience—especially for less tech-savvy users.
</p>

<h3>Current Format – Key Issues</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Reliance on Desktop Excel</strong><br>
    Participants had to download a spreadsheet, input scores, save the file, and email it back—introducing friction from the start and no mobile-friendly alternative.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Tech Literacy Gaps</strong><br>
    Some users didn’t have Excel, while others accidentally formatted scores as dates or submitted blank files, resulting in confusion and back-and-forth.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Manual Submissions</strong><br>
    One family member (who will not be named!) wrote all their scores on paper, photographed it, and texted it to me—only to miss two fixtures. She still beat me in the final table.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Design Challenge</h3>

<p>I set out to build a tool that:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Simplifies the Experience</strong> – Make it easy for everyone to enter predictions—especially those with limited digital experience.</li>
  <li><strong>Adds Enjoyment</strong> – Move beyond spreadsheets to something more visually engaging and interactive.</li>
  <li><strong>Creates Value</strong> – With all predictions captured centrally, there's potential for data visualisation and storytelling.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Importantly, the prototype still exports an Excel file to maintain compatibility with the current system, but this can evolve with organiser input.
</p>





<h3>Design Approach</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Wireframes</strong><br>
    I began by sketching the user journey and basic screens, focusing on a smooth experience. This began as desktop-first but quickly developed into a mobile-friendly flow.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>User Flows</strong><br>
    Tested edge cases—scores are saved locally in case of a crash, and a “Clear All” button was added with a reset confirmation to avoid accidental loss.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Key Features</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Season Summary Tool</strong><br>
    After submitting predictions, users get a snapshot of how their season might play out. It highlights their overall tone—optimistic or pessimistic—compared to realistic outcomes, helping players imagine their season unfolding and adding narrative to what was once a static task.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Fixture Colour Coding</strong><br>
    Visual cues change fixture colours based on predicted results (win, draw, loss), making it easier to interpret at a glance.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Records Awareness (Planned Feature)</strong><br>
    The app could flag if a prediction breaks a historical record—e.g. “10–0 vs Sunderland would be our biggest ever league win.”
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>User Feedback</h3>

<blockquote>
  “I would definitely use this for next season’s challenge.”
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  “Love the visual colour change of the fixtures based on the result I predicted.”
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  “The season report is a great overview of my predictions—definitely too optimistic!”
</blockquote>

<h3>Next Steps</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Add admin tools for compiling results and managing leaderboards</li>
  <li>Explore real-time prediction comparisons and historical stats</li>
  <li>Integrate with external fixture APIs for live updates</li>
  <li>Review whether Excel remains the best database format going forward</li>
</ul>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    I researched, designed, and built a modern web app version of the <strong>Wembley 2016 board game</strong> using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal was to preserve the nostalgic value of the original while solving long-standing usability and relevance issues. The live site replaces outdated, often misplaced physical components with a dynamic, customisable digital experience.

  <h2>Original Game – Key Issues</h2>

<p><strong>Complexity:</strong> Cumbersome rules and fiddly mechanics (especially money distribution) slowed down gameplay and frustrated players.</p>

<p><strong>Dependence on Physical Components:</strong> The game relied on custom dice and hard-to-find rule books—making it unplayable if anything was missing.</p>

<p><strong>Unfair Mechanics:</strong> Dice outcomes felt unbalanced, and team strength lacked transparency, affecting fairness.</p>

<p><strong>Outdated Elements:</strong> Team lineups became obsolete quickly due to promotion and relegation in real-world football.</p>

<h2>Design Approach</h2>

<p><strong>User Experience First:</strong> Created wireframes focused on how players choose teams—prioritising alphabetical ordering, visual clarity, and intuitive layout.</p>

<p><strong>Modern Interface:</strong> Drawing inspiration from football apps and live broadcasts, I introduced updated club badges, player ratings, and a clean, football-fan-friendly interface.</p>

<p><strong>Enhanced Gameplay Context:</strong> Key gameplay variables—like international stars, game rules, and available funds—are clearly presented before kickoff to reduce confusion mid-game.</p>

<p><strong>Customisable Mechanics:</strong> Dice rolls, team selection, and gameplay elements are now fully customisable, allowing for up-to-date seasonal versions and flexible rule sets.</p>

  <h2>Player Feedback</h2>
  <blockquote>
    “Love the modern feel, especially the updated club badges.”
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    “Made playing so much easier—no more fumbling with money or dice.”
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    “Feels like waiting for scores on the telly again—nostalgic but smoother!”
  </blockquote>

  <h2>Next Steps</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Develop themed visual "skins" for earlier and newer seasons</li>
    <li>Explore seasonal data integration for real-time updates</li>
    <li>Investigate multiplayer and AI-driven gameplay options</li>
  </ul>
